        <h2 class = "fade-up">
            The winners of each event will be invited to compete in the 2026 PSL Championship, held in Las Vegas, Nevada this October. Here, a last-chance qualifier will be hosted on the same day to fill in our wild cards of the championship. 
            <br><br>
            There can be up to 6 unique winners invited to the championship, however there will be scenarios where we can encounter repeat winners, which subsequently create wild card qualifications and merit qualifications. Below is a flow chart on how we determine the amount of each:

            What does this mean? It means that every solve that you complete in the 2026 PSL season has significant meaning. We are extracting every data point to see who should be rewarded for a chance to compete at our championship for our grand prize. It means that somebody watching you from home is hoping you don’t reach a certain time because that means they are knocked out of contention. It creates tension in a new form and entertainment for all.
            <br><br>
            It means if you failed your attempts at local PSL events, that you can make your way to Las Vegas for one last chance to go at the championship if you feel like you have the capability to do so. Will you be the one to rise up to the occasion and make a name for yourself in the history books?
