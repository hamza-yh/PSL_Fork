        <h1 class="mini-title leftsection fade-down">12/15/25 - The 2026 PSL Season is Here</h1>
        <h2 class="fade-up">  
        Hey Everyone,
        <br><br>
        Since our launch in January, we have successfully completed 5 PSL events: Berkeley, San Diego, Sacramento, Las Vegas and Seattle - with Michigan capping off our inaugural season. We will now officially call this season the 2025 PSL season for historical context.
        <br><br>
        We have spent a lot of effort in hypothesizing and testing different ideas to see what would best work. Some things we spent considerable amounts of time analyzing include:
        <br><br>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Real-time instant replay review</li>
            <li>Regulations</li>
            <li>Format</li>
            <li>Division Rank-up Systems</li>
            <li>Outdoor events</li>
            <li>Marketing</li>
            <li>PSL Rankings</li>
            <li>Fully automated data entry</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        Now, while exploring different ideas is fundamental for growth and innovation, it undoubtedly leaves an opportunity for creating a sense of continuity between events. Therefore, it’s time to share with everyone that we are officially announcing the 2026 PSL season.
        <br><br>
        All of our events are announced for the tour, so that you can make your plans early on attending. Each event will feature a pro division of 6 cubers in a double-elimination bracket, as tested and supported by PSL Sacramento and PSL Seattle in the 2025 season. The winner of our pro division will be invited to compete at the first ever PSL Championship in Downtown Container Park in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada.
        <br><br>
        The details of this championship will be announced shortly after the time of this blog post release. This championship event will also feature a last-chance qualifier on the same day for individuals who weren’t able to attend previous events, or just missed the cut.
        <br><br>
        We are extremely excited to bring you along this journey with our first fleshed-out season. If you haven’t already, stay up to date by following us on primarily YouTube and Instagram. Much of our information will also be shared through our primary retail partner, <a href="https://speedcubeshop.com/collections/psl-premier-speedcubing-league">Speedcubeshop</a>. To follow our tour schedule as closely as possible without using social media, please follow us on our <a href="https://www.start.gg/hub/the-premier-speedcubing-league">start.gg hub</a>, as our championship event, format and stakes will also be consolidated on this front page.
        <br><br>
        So competitors - are you ready to compete for your chance at making the Pros? Find a competition near you.
        <br><br>
        Onwards,

            <h1 class="mini-title leftsection fade-down">7/28/25 - Introducing Divisions and PSL Vegas Updates!</h1>

             <h2 class="fade-up">Hey everyone, here are some MAJOR announcements for PSL as an organization, 
             as well as our upcoming event in Las Vegas on September 1st! <br><br>

            <b>1)  GFuel Energy Partnership</b><br>
            We are happy to announce that the GFuel energy is the official hydration partner of the PSL!
             You can use discount code “PSL” at <a href="https://gfuel.com/psl">https://gfuel.com/psl</a> and save 20% off your next order.
              Have you seen those Rubik’s tumblers? They are totally worth getting! How will you choose to rep the brand?<br><br>

           <b>2) Divisions</b><br>
            We are implementing beginners, intermediate and pro divisions starting at Vegas Sep 1. This
             is because we want to create an environment of higher and personalized participation at PSL
              that is able to still draw from a head-to-head format.<br><br>


            <b>3) Opening FREE competing to everyone</b><br>
            With this division implementation, we decided to open up free competing registration to everyone!
             If you are interested in competing at the PSL but was previously intimidated by the skillcap, check
              it out! We want everyone to have fun.<br><br>


            <b>4) Venue Change</b><br>
            We are moving the event to Downtown Container Park. An outdoor festival shopping mall venue with
             plenty of food, entertainment and amenities. Check them out on instagram if you want an idea of what
              it looks like - we don't think you'll be disappointed! This venue will be open to all spectators since 
              there will be plenty of noncubers hovering the space. Therefore, anyone who has purchased a spectator
               ticket will be refunded and offered to compete instead. <br><br>

            We are still looking to improve the symbiotic experience of a league and one thing we are specifically
             looking at is the relationship between divisions. You'll see that the winner of the intermediate division 
             will be able to go on stream against the pros - if anyone has ideas similar to that to provide rewards
              to intermediate or beginners divisions, let us know via the proper feedback channels! Stay tuned for
               upcoming events and register for PSL Vegas at <a href="https://start.gg/pslv/register">https://start.gg/pslv/register</a> <br><br>

            <h2 class="fade-up">Hey everyone,<br><br>

                We are excited to announce that <b>“SKATE”</b> by DG the Artist is the official theme song of the PSL for Season 1. We believe 
                this to be a part of our overall direction of a league being made by cubers, for cubers.<br><br>
                
                His song perfectly encapsulates the epic energy we aim to achieve here in the PSL. If you’ve purchased tickets, be ready 
                to jam out with us in-person on March 16th! If you cannot, you can party with us virtually by tuning into the broadcasts 
                on SpeedcubingTV. <br><br>
